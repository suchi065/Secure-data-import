# 🔐 Secure Data Import and Protection Framework in ServiceNow

## 📘 Overview

This project explores the **secure data import and protection mechanisms** within the ServiceNow platform. The goal is to ensure that data coming into ServiceNow—especially from external or sensitive sources—is handled securely and complies with organizational and regulatory data protection standards.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Understand the **best practices for importing data securely** in ServiceNow.
- Leverage **ServiceNow's built-in tools** to protect sensitive information.
- Implement **role-based access controls (RBAC)** for data handling.
- Avoid common pitfalls such as unencrypted transfers or unauthorized access.

---

## 🧩 Key Features

### ✅ 1. Secure Data Import Methods
- **Data Sources:** Import sets, Excel, CSV, Web Services, REST APIs.
- **Security Measures:** Use HTTPS, SFTP, and OAuth2 for secure connections.
- **Validation Rules:** Ensure data accuracy and prevent malicious payloads.

### ✅ 2. Field-Level Encryption
- Encrypt sensitive fields such as SSN, passwords, and financial data.
- Enable **Edge Encryption** or use **Data At-Rest Encryption**.

### ✅ 3. Data Loss Prevention (DLP)
- Create policies to detect and block risky imports.
- Audit logs and activity monitoring for traceability.

### ✅ 4. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Use ACLs (Access Control Lists) to manage who can import/view data.
- Restrict access to sensitive tables and fields.

### ✅ 5. Protection with Data Policies
- Enforce data formatting and integrity checks.
- Prevent unauthorized updates or deletions.

## 🔐 Security Considerations

- Always import data over **secure channels (HTTPS, SFTP)**.
- Enable **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** for import users.
- Use **Scoped Applications** to isolate logic and prevent unauthorized access.
- Regularly audit import logs and access history.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

- **Platform:** ServiceNow
- **Security Tools:** Edge Encryption, Data Classification Plugin
- **Import Tools:** Import Sets, Transform Maps, REST/SOAP Integrations

---

## 📈 Benefits

- Prevents data breaches during import.
- Ensures regulatory compliance (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.).
- Increases trust and transparency in enterprise workflows.
